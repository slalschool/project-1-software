LIBRARY SOFTWARE PROJECT by Siddharth Lal and Jason Li

Idea:
Online library

Goals:
1) Be able to borrow and return books from an online selection
2) Be easy and simple to use
3) Allow new users to join
4) Give an admin overview of users and their actions

Planning Stages:
1) Log in and register page
2) Data types within app
3) Book transaction logic
4) Implementing this with a GUI

Challenges:
Not using a database made it so any data created in the session will not remain after the session
Implementing a GUI
Getting hang of how to create layout of components and arrange it within the app
    ex:
    top row was a panel using grid layout using one row and three columns
    buttons might not stay in a row and managing space, so i changed jframe length
